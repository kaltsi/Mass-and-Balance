# Add your extra load points following the scheme from above
#
# Each load point must have a unique name.
#
# It makes sense to add only new interactive points, because you can adjust their loading,
# which then affects the take-off and landing masses.
# The mass unit has to be "kg".
#
# For example:
#
# An interactive point, named "Test point", values in kg, default=50, min=10, max=100,
# moment-arm=1.5, slider-step=0.1
# LOAD_POINT=LP_I_YOUR_POINT "Test#point" "Testi#piste" "kg" 50 10 100 1.5 0.1

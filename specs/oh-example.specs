# New load points can be added.
#
# The load points appear in the table in the order they are introduced below.
#
# LP_N_xxx = non-interactive load point xxx
# LP_R_xxx = non-interactive load point xxx, with reversed output cells
# LP_I_xxx = interactive load point xxx, the default value will be saveable
# LP_F_xxx = interactive fuel flow load point xxx, the default value will be saveable
# LP_C_xxx = interactive checkbox row, saveable
#
# The checkbox state is ON if max value = default value.
#
# Name English Finnish unit default min max moment-arm [step]
#
# If the max value is a negative value, it is not printed out in the description.
#
# Substitute all spaces with '#' in the English/Finnish field.
#
# The [step] is optional, it sets how discrete steps the slider takes when adjusted.
#
# Each load point must have a unique name.
#
# It makes sense to add only new interactive points, because you can adjust their loading,
# which then affects the take-off and landing masses.
#
# The mass unit has to be "kg" or "ltr".
#
# The following names are fixed.
# You can't change these names,but you can rearrange them if you wish.
#
# You can also remove the back seat row.

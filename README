This project aims to provide mass and balance calculation sheets for
specific aircraft. The intention is that the sheets should be usable
without an internet connection after a sheet has been downloaded to
the local computer (iPad etc.).

The publish page for the sheets is here:

If you want to create an m&b sheet for your own plane, take a look at
the existing specification files under the specs subdirectory. Then
create a new file there and run the export.sh script. The script will
apply the specs to the template.html file and create the plane
specific m&b sheets.
